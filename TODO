Interresting idea (from feedback)
- The ability to browse and actively add music from folder structure.
- Actual GUI button to highlight currently playing song
- API for third partie modules (foobar compatility)

nice to have
- Transcoding -> exporting to external device (meaning device management) can reencore as exporting to compatible format or for smaller file size.
