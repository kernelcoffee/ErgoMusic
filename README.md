ErgoMusic
=========

ErgoMusic is a Qt-based open-source music player and manager.
It is inspired by iTunes for which I haven't found a suitable replacmement.

But why ?
---------

Long term Itunes user, I now share my time between multiple computers, all of them on linux.
Even though there is plenty of valuable music player, none met my requirements :
- Cross-platform (but primary use for Linux).
- No-streaming (I tend to travel and I prefer to have my music on my hard-drive).
- Intuitive music import system.
- Self-hosting server side to sync multiple client on playlist and songs.
- Simple UI : menu on the left, main view in the middle.
- Itunes like behavior : when doucle-clik on a song it plays it, it doesn't add it to a queue-list.
- A felling of finished product, since I'm the one creating it, I'll be able to tune the software for the feeling I want.
